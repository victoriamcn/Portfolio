# Victoria McNorrill's Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio website was created so I can showcase my work to potential employers. Right now, this is a static website. As I learn JavaScript, I want to make my portfolio more interactive.

While creating this project, I learned it is best for me, as a developer, to outline what elements I want to incorporate and how I want the layout to look like befre diving into CSS. I also learned that having a reset.css file is good practice to better the UI/UX accross all browsers.
