# Victoria McNorrill's Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio website was created so I can showcase my work to potential employers. Right now, this is a static website. As I learn JavaScript, I want to make my portfolio more interactive.

While creating this project, I learned it is best for me, as a developer, to outline what elements I want to incorporate and how I want the layout to look like befre diving into CSS.

I also learned that having a reset.css file is good practice to better the UI/UX accross all browsers.

## User Story

1. AS AN employer
2. I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
3. SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Below are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
- THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
- THEN I am taken to that deployed application
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
- THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport'
